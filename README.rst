Symfony Recipes (Contrib)
=========================

Symfony recipes allow the automation of Composer packages configuration via the
`Symfony Flex`_ Composer plugin.

This repository hosts contributed recipes for Composer packages that are not
part of the "official" `Symfony recipes`_. To enable recipes defined in this
repository for your project, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer config extra.symfony.allow-contrib true

managed by the community.
